# Wireshark – Network Traffic Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical network traffic analysis using Wireshark as part of cybersecurity lab exercises.  
The objective is to gain hands-on understanding of common network protocols and packet-level communication.

## Tools & Environment
- Tool: Wireshark  
- OS: Windows / Linux  
- Protocols: TCP, HTTPS (TLS), DNS  

## Methodology
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark  
- Applied protocol filters to analyze specific packets  
- Inspected packet headers and protocol fields  
- Observed normal network communication behavior  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are provided to demonstrate packet capture and analysis.

- **tcp_handshake.png**: Shows the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)  
- **tls_https.png**: Shows encrypted HTTPS (TLS) traffic and visible metadata  
- **dns_query.png**: Shows DNS domain name resolution from query to response  

## Result
Successfully analyzed multiple network protocols and understood how data flows across a network.

## Ethical Notice
This lab was performed on personal network traffic in a controlled environment for learning purposes only.  
No unauthorized traffic interception was conducted.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding TCP connection establishment  
- Visibility limitations of encrypted HTTPS traffic  
- Role of DNS in network communication  
- Practical use of Wireshark filters and packet inspection
