# Network Traffic Analysis Lab – Wireshark

## Overview
This project demonstrates **practical network traffic analysis** using Wireshark.  
The objective is to gain hands-on understanding of common network protocols and packet-level communication.

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Tool:** Wireshark  
- **Operating System:** Windows / Linux  
- **Protocols Analyzed:** TCP, HTTPS (TLS), DNS

---

## Methodology
1. Captured live network traffic using Wireshark  
2. Applied protocol filters to analyze specific packets  
3. Inspected packet headers and protocol fields  
4. Observed normal network communication behavior  

---

## Screenshots
- **tcp_handshake.png:** Shows the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)  
- **tls_https.png:** Shows encrypted HTTPS (TLS) traffic and visible metadata  
- **dns_query.png:** Shows DNS domain name resolution from query to response  

---

## Result
Successfully analyzed multiple network protocols and understood how data flows across a network.

---

## Ethical Notice
This lab was performed on **personal network traffic** in a controlled environment for learning purposes only.  
No unauthorized traffic interception was conducted.

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding TCP connection establishment  
- Visibility limitations of encrypted HTTPS traffic  
- Role of DNS in network communication  
- Practical use of Wireshark filters and packet inspection
